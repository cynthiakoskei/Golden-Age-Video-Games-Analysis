# Golden Age of Video Games Analysis

Welcome to the Golden Age of Video Games Analysis project! In this project, we delve into the realm of video games to uncover insights into the most celebrated years in gaming history. By analyzing critic and user scores along with sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977, we aim to identify the golden age of video games and explore the dynamics between critical acclaim and commercial success.

## Project Description

In this project, we embark on a journey through decades of video game history, armed with SQL skills to navigate and analyze datasets containing critic and user scores, as well as sales data. The mission is to unearth the years that stood out as the pinnacle of gaming excellence, both in terms of critical reception and commercial performance.

### Key Tasks:

1. **Data Analysis:** Utilize SQL queries to analyze and join datasets containing critic and user scores, as well as sales data for the top 400 video games released since 1977.
2. **Identify Trends:** Employ set theory and filtering techniques to identify years that resonate as the golden age of video games, considering both critical acclaim and sales figures.
3. **Data Manipulation:** Apply filtering, grouping, and ordering operations to extract meaningful insights from the datasets.
4. **Visualization (Optional):** Optionally, visualize your findings using suitable tools to present your insights effectively.
